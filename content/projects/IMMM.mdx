Everyone wants to adopt the latest innovation and create a culture that spurs their own, but many organizations do not consider their readiness to alter operations and habits for innovations to foster a lasting business impact. Innovation is a unique and fiscal beast that requires a specific set of dimensions to come together in just the right way. To understand these dimensions, we can lean on Gartner's Innovation Maturity Model (IMMM). A starting place to understand your current organizational state, identify target states, and define the actions needed to progress to desired levels of competency.
To assess an enterprises innovation capability 6 key dimensions, need to be understood:
Strategy & Intent â€“ Demonstration of intent to innovate through strategic commitment, funding, alignment of resources, and design of incentives.
Processes & Practices â€“ Formalization of process models to reliably generate ideas and manage them through to resolution (implementation, commercialization, termination, monetization, etc). All in the name of promoting business agility to drive creativity and the ability to act on thinking outside current boundaries.
Culture & People â€“ Understanding of social behaviors (whether customers, employees, or others) and managing the impact of these behaviors across the innovation process; an inclusive environment for recognizing value.
Organization & Infrastructure â€“ A variety of supporting organizational structures, resources, and tools that establish and sustain innovation management, with scale in mind, from ideation to implementation.
Partnerships & Open Innovation â€“ Active relationships and access to innovators and innovations that are both internal and external.
Innovating How You Innovate â€“ Ability to continually adapt and adopt relevant new ideas and practices.
Together these dimensions can provide insight as to what level of Innovation Management an enterprise is at:
Level 1 -> Reactive
Level 2 -> Active
Level 3 -> Defined
Level 4 -> Performing
Level 5 -> Pervasive
While assessing against the IMMM, it is important to keep in mind that managing innovation and the act of innovating are not the same. While innovations may arise as the result of luck, opportunity or the force of a single creative personality, mature management is necessary to build an effective, repeatable and, in particular, lasting environment that fosters great ideas, discoveries and, ultimately, innovations. This maturity model is designed to assess the enterpriseâ€™s readiness to managing innovation as a repeatable and enduring competency (Fenn & Harris, 2011). Table 1 provides an overview of how this all comes together:

So now that an enterprises innovation maturity level can be understood, how do we act on it?
In short, this is just the beginning. A current state understanding is instrumental for knowing where your areas of opportunity are but this all needs be orchestrated across your unique and complex environments. Enterprise Architecture is your friend here, engage your EA's and use your IMMM results as an artifact to drive strategic decisions and influence stakeholders to change.
